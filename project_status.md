# CXR Reports Classification Project Status

## Project Overview
This project is designed to classify chest X-ray (CXR) reports into three categories using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model:
- 0: Normal reports
- 1: Abnormal reports
- 2: Uncertain reports or reports mentioning lines, catheters, or tubes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Set up Python virtual environment using uv package
- [x] Created requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
- [x] Created extractor.py script to:
  - Load and process the Excel file (radiology_cleaned4.xlsx)
  - Utilize OpenAI API to classify reports
  - Save results to a new Excel file (radiology_classified.xlsx)
  - Implement error handling and logging
  - Allow for resumption of processing if interrupted
- [x] Fixed API parameter issues:
  - Switched from o3-mini to gpt-3.5-turbo model for more reliable results
  - Implemented retry mechanism for failed API calls
  - Enhanced result validation to extract valid classifications
  - Improved error handling and logging
- [x] Created enhanced test_extractor.py script with direct API testing
- [x] Created table.py for analyzing and visualizing classification results:
  - Displays classification distribution in tabular format
  - Generates pie chart visualization
  - Shows completion statistics and sample reports
- [x] Fixed Excel file format issues:
  - Explicitly specified 'openpyxl' engine for all pandas Excel operations
  - Enhanced error handling for file loading problems
  - Added fallback to load original file if the classified file is problematic

## Current Tasks
- [ ] Run the full classification process
- [ ] Monitor API usage and adjust rate limiting if necessary
- [ ] Analyze classification results using table.py

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Fine-tune classification criteria if needed
- [ ] Consider fine-tuning the model with expert-labeled data if needed
- [ ] Implement any additional quality checks on the classifications
- [ ] Create more advanced visualizations if required

## Technical Implementation Details
- Using pandas for Excel file handling with explicit openpyxl engine
- Implementing robust logging to track progress and errors
- Using OpenAI's API with rate limiting to avoid hitting API limits
- Periodic saving of results to prevent data loss in case of interruption
- Retry mechanism for handling API failures or empty responses
- More frequent save points (every 5 reports instead of 10)
- Data visualization with matplotlib and tabulate
- Error handling for Excel file format issues
